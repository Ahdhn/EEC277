%========================= Target ====================================%
The target of our project can be summed in the following milestone 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Implementing of ray tracing on fragment shader. (1 Week)
\item Implementing uniform gird, kd-tree to accelerate the performance
\item Experimenting with complex scenes. (1 Week)
\item In parallel, implementation on CUDA for final comparison between OpenGL-based and CUDA-based ray tracing. (1 Week)
\item Report and presentation. (1 Week)
\end{enumerate}
